Magnesium salt was applied in the first greenhouse, but the second was not added. The first produced 10 kg of cucumber and the second produced 5 kg. Nothing was applied to the greenhouse other than water, and the higher yields of the first greenhouse must be due to magnesium salts.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, has most severely weakened the above argument? ?\n\n Option:\nA:A small amount of magnesium salt is found in the soil of the two experimental greenhouses.;\nB:The third experimental greenhouse applied a high nitrogen fertilizer but no magnesium salt, yielding 7 kg of cucumber.;\nC: different cucumber varieties planted in both experimental greenhouses.;\nD:The soil quality and sunshine amount of the two experimental greenhouses are different.;\n\n\n Answer:[D]\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nThe same number of eggplant seedlings were planted in the two test greenhouses. Only the first greenhouse was applied with fertilizer nails, but not the second greenhouse. The first greenhouse produced 1200 kg of eggplant, and the second greenhouse produced 900 kg of eggplant. Apart from water, nothing else was applied to these two greenhouses, so it must be that the fertilizer A led to the first greenhouse with a higher yield of eggplant.\n\nIf the following statement is true, which one most severely weakened the argument above?\n\n Option:\nA:A small amount of fertilizer A penetrates from the first greenhouse to the second greenhouse.;\nB:The same variety of eggplant seedlings were planted in two greenhouses.;\nC:The soil quality and sunshine amount of the two greenhouses are different.;\nD:Fertilizer B was applied in the third greenhouse, and fertilizer A was not applied, yielding 1,000 kg of eggplant.;\n", "answer": "The soil quality and sunshine amount of the two greenhouses are different.", "answer_idx": "C"}
{"query": "Example:\nExmapleQuestion:\nAs an edible sugar, fructose has been widely used in the food processing industry. Fructose stays in the blood after entering human cells, and its metabolic pathway in the human body is not related to insulin, and human intake does not cause blood sugar and insulin levels. Therefore, fructose has a smaller effect on glucose in patients with diabetes than glucose, and diabetes patients do not increase their blood glucose significantly after ingesting fructose. Therefore, fructose is a sugar that is good for health.\n\nIf the following are true, which of the following can't weaken the above conclusion?\n\n Option:\nA:In people with high fructose intake, the incidence of obesity and obesity-related diseases is significantly higher and average.;\nB:Fructose enters the body and is more easily converted into triglycerides than glucose, eventually producing more fat and accumulating in the internal organs.;\nC:Fructose is hydrolyzed from starch. Starch first breaks down into glucose and then transforms the mixture of fructose and glucose, so fructose does not come from fruits.;\nD:Long-term intake of large amounts of fructose can lead to increased insulin resistance, which is thought to reduce the sensitivity of insulin to changes in blood glucose, and in severe cases can lead to diabetes.;\n\n\n Answer:[C]\n\n\n\nQuestion:\nIt is wrong to say that foods with a high content of refined sugar will not cause acquired diabetes, because foods with a high content of refined sugar will cause obesity, and obesity is an important cause of acquired diabetes.\n\nWhich of the following is most similar to the above argument?\n\n Option:\nA:It is wrong to say that Alexander is a Plato student. In fact, Alexander was a student of Aristotle, and Aristotle was a student of Plato.;\nB:It is true that excessive fertilization is the main cause of lawn diseases and insect pests. Because excessive fertilization can cause the grass to grow madly, and the grass that grows madly has little resistance to diseases and insect pests.;\nC:It is wrong for people who frequently participate in strenuous exercise to cause sudden death. Because the violent cause is cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and vigorous exercise does not necessarily cause cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.;\nD:It is wrong to say that inferior gasoline will not cause abnormal fuel consumption. Because inferior gasoline can cause very normal aging of engine valves, and abnormal aging of motive valves can cause abnormal fuel consumption.;\n", "answer": "It is wrong to say that inferior gasoline will not cause abnormal fuel consumption.
